# StudiOn

NOW LIVE AND FULL RESPONSIVE AT: http://studion-institutional-brittocx.surge.sh/

This is a test home page made by me according to the Front End Developer course at Imagine School.



StudiOn is a <strike>fake</strike> Event and Services provider.



In this project I was not limited to using HTML and CSS, I also used some JavaScript as I also got familiar with jQuery.
The homepage is also responsive and working on mobile devices.
