# StudiOn

Now the page is online at: http://studion-institutional-brittocx.surge.sh/

This is a test home page made by me according to the Front End Developer course at Imagine School.



StudiOn is a <strike>fake</strike> Event and Services provider.



In this project I was not limited to using HTML and CSS, I also used some JavaScript as I also got familiar with jQuery.
The homepage is also responsive and working on mobile devices.



Next updates:
* Creation of the Company, Events, Gallery and Testimonials pages, currently only the home page and contacts are working.
* Add responsiveness to the contacts page and the others, since only the home page is fully responsive.
